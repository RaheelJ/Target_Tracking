# Target_Tracking
Software implementation of multiple target tracking research algorithms in C++. Please contact author for access and further details. So far following algorithms have been successfully implemented for intercepting hypersonic glide vehicles:
1. Multi-Stage Guidance Law for Hypersonic Glide Vehicles
2. Non-Linear Proportional Guidance Law
3. Fractional Guidance Law
4. Coordinated Guidance Law with Modified Proportional Control for the Leader
